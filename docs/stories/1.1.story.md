# Story 1.1: Install and Launch Application, Display Main Interface

## Status: Implemented

## Story

-   As an AI Enthusiast,
-   I want to install (from the prepared environment) and launch the Sourcer application,
-   so that I can see the main interface.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  Application installs successfully into the development environment using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (and dev dependencies if needed for running).
2.  Application launches via `scripts/run_dev.sh` or `python src/sourcer/main.py` and displays a main window.
3.  The main window has a clear title (e.g., "Sourcer MVP").
4.  A designated area for webcam feed is present in the main window layout.
5.  A designated area for chat/log history is present in the main window layout.
6.  A text input field is present in the main window layout.
7.  Basic UI elements are stubs or placeholders but visually distinct within the layout.

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] **Task 1: Verify Development Environment Installation (AC: 1)**
    -   [x] Ensure `requirements.txt` (from Story 1.0) lists necessary runtime packages (e.g., `PyQt6`, `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `pipecat-ai`). Update if necessary.
    -   [x] (Developer Agent) Test running `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` in a clean virtual environment based on Story 1.0 setup. Document any issues.
-   [x] **Task 2: Implement Application Launch Logic (AC: 2)**
    -   [x] Modify `src/sourcer/main.py` to correctly import and run the main application class from `src/sourcer/app.py`.
    -   [x] Modify `src/sourcer/app.py`:
        -   [x] Initialize a `QApplication` instance.
        -   [x] Instantiate the main window class (e.g., `MainWindow` from `src/sourcer/ui/main_window.py`).
        -   [x] Show the main window.
        -   [x] Start the Qt event loop (`app.exec()`).
-   [x] **Task 3: Create Basic Main Window (AC: 2, 3)**
    -   [x] Create `src/sourcer/ui/main_window.py`.
    -   [x] Define a `MainWindow` class inheriting from `QMainWindow`.
    -   [x] In its constructor (`__init__`):
        -   [x] Set the window title to "Sourcer MVP".
        -   [x] Define a basic size (e.g., 1024x768) and make it resizable.
        -   [x] Set up a central widget and a main layout (e.g., `QVBoxLayout` or `QHBoxLayout` or `QGridLayout` depending on the chosen layout from UI/UX spec).
-   [x] **Task 4: Implement Main UI Layout with Placeholders (AC: 4, 5, 6, 7)**
    -   [x] Based on the conceptual layout from the UI/UX Specification (e.g., `Sourcer-MVP-Wireframes-and-Mockups.txt` - Option A or B discussed previously), add placeholder widgets for the key UI areas within `MainWindow`:
        -   [x] **Webcam Display Area:** Create a stub widget (e.g., `WebcamDisplayWidget` placeholder, perhaps a simple `QLabel` or `QFrame` with a distinct background color) and add it to the layout.
        -   [x] **Chat/Log History Area:** Create a stub widget (e.g., `ChatLogWidget` placeholder, perhaps a `QTextEdit` set to read-only or a `QListWidget`) and add it to the layout.
        -   [x] **Input Control Area:** Create a container widget (e.g., `InputControlWidget` placeholder as a `QFrame` or `QWidget`) for the input elements.
            -   [x] **Text Input Field:** Add a `QLineEdit` within the Input Control Area.
            -   [x] *(Note: Voice activation button and status indicator are for later stories but the area should accommodate them)*.
    -   [x] Ensure these placeholder widgets are visually distinct (e.g., different background colors or simple borders for now) so their presence and layout can be verified.
-   [x] **Task 5: Verify Launch Scripts (AC: 2)**
    -   [x] Ensure `scripts/run_dev.sh` (if used) correctly invokes `python src/sourcer/main.py` within the activated virtual environment.

## Dev Technical Guidance

-   **Framework:** Use PyQt6 for all UI components.
-   **Main Window:** `src/sourcer/ui/main_window.py` should contain the `MainWindow` class.
-   **Layout:** Refer to the UI/UX Specification (`Sourcer-MVP-Wireframes-and-Mockups.txt`) for the main window layout (e.g., the two-pane or three-section vertical layout). Implement one of these using appropriate Qt layout managers (`QHBoxLayout`, `QVBoxLayout`, `QGridLayout`, `QSplitter`).
-   **Placeholder Widgets:** For this story, the areas for webcam, chat, and input controls can be simple `QFrame` or `QLabel` widgets with distinct styling (e.g., background color) to verify their placement. Actual functionality will be added in subsequent stories. The `QLineEdit` for text input should be a functional `QLineEdit` widget.
-   **Styling:** No complex styling is required for this story beyond making placeholders visually identifiable.
-   **Application Entry Point:** Ensure `src/sourcer/main.py` is the primary script to launch the application. `src/sourcer/app.py` should encapsulate the `QApplication` and `MainWindow` instantiation and execution.
-   **Installation:** The "installation" in AC1 refers to setting up the development environment correctly using `pip` and the requirements files. The application isn't being packaged for distribution in this story.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: <Jules>

### Completion Notes List
- Updated `requirements.txt` with core runtime dependencies. Versions for some packages (pipecat-ai, numpy, opencv-python, ultralytics, Pillow) were added without specific version pins, relying on pip to pick the latest stable. A `pip install --dry-run` was successful.
- Modified `src/sourcer/main.py` and `src/sourcer/app.py` to handle application initialization (`QApplication`) and launch the main window.
- Created `src/sourcer/ui/main_window.py` with a `MainWindow` class.
- Implemented a basic UI layout in `MainWindow` with placeholders for webcam feed, chat/log history, and a text input field. The layout uses QVBoxLayout and QHBoxLayout with QFrame, QLabel, QTextEdit, and QLineEdit widgets.
- Created `scripts/run_dev.sh` to facilitate application launch.
- Full verification of UI display (AC2, AC3, AC4, AC5, AC6, AC7) requires manual execution in a graphical environment.
