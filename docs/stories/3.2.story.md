# Story 3.2: Ensure Local Visual Analysis for Privacy

## Status: Approved

## Story

-   As a Privacy-Conscious User,
-   I want to be assured that the visual analysis occurs entirely on my device,
-   so that my visual data remains private.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  During the execution of visual analysis by the `VisionService` (triggered by a query), network monitoring tools (e.g., Wireshark, OS resource monitor) show no outbound network traffic from the Sourcer application related to image data, intermediate AI model inputs/outputs, or generated textual descriptions to any external servers. (AC based on)
2.  A code review confirms that all AI models used by `VisionService` (YOLO, MobileSAM, LLaVA) are loaded from local file paths (as configured in `config/settings.ini` or default paths within the `models/` directory) and that their inference/prediction methods are invoked directly without unintended network calls. (AC based on)
3.  The `VisionService` and its constituent model wrappers (`YOLOModelWrapper`, `MobileSAMModelWrapper`, `LLaVAModelWrapper`) do not contain any code that would intentionally or unintentionally transmit image data or derived features to external endpoints.
4.  (For Developer Verification) Adding a temporary DEBUG log statement at the beginning and end of the `VisionService.analyze_frame` method and in model loading sections confirms that operations are proceeding as expected locally.
5.  Documentation (e.g., a section in the README or a dedicated privacy note) explicitly states that all AI processing for visual analysis is performed locally.

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [ ] **Task 1: Code Review for Local Processing Confirmation (AC: 2, 3)**
    -   [ ] Review the implementation of `VisionService` (`src/sourcer/services/vision_service.py`) and the AI model wrapper classes.
    -   [ ] Verify that model loading logic uses local file paths (e.g., derived from `config/settings.ini` or a predefined local `models/` directory structure).
    -   [ ] Verify that the inference calls to YOLO, MobileSAM, and LLaVA libraries/APIs are local calls and do not initiate network connections for processing.
    -   [ ] Ensure no third-party libraries used within these components are making unexpected external calls with image data or derivatives.
-   [ ] **Task 2: Network Traffic Monitoring Test (AC: 1)**
    -   [ ] Prepare a test setup where the Sourcer application is running and processing visual queries.
    -   [ ] Use a network monitoring tool (e.g., Wireshark on the developer's machine, or OS-provided network activity monitor like Resource Monitor on Windows) to observe network traffic from the `Sourcer.exe` (or `python` process if running from
