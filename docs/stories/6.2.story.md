# Story 6.2: Create Basic User Instructions (README)

## Status: Approved

## Story

-   As an AI Early Adopter,
-   I want basic instructions on how to use Sourcer's MVP features,
-   so that I can understand its capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  The main `README.md` file in the project root is updated (or created if the developer-focused one from Story 1.0's recommendation was not made primary) to serve as a user-friendly guide.
2.  The README includes a clear "Installation" section with step-by-step instructions on how to download and run the Windows installer (`.exe` from Story 6.1).
3.  The README includes a "Launching Sourcer" section explaining how to start the application after installation (e.g., via Start Menu or Desktop shortcut).
4.  The README includes a "Basic Usage" section detailing:
    * How to initiate a voice query using the `MicrophoneActivationControl`.
    * How to type and submit a text query using the `TextInputField` and "Send" button.
    * A brief explanation of the UI layout: webcam feed area, chat/log display, and input controls.
5.  The README includes a section or note listing the 10-15 common household/office objects the MVP is primarily expected to recognize accurately (as defined in PRD Functional Requirements).
6.  The README includes a "Known Limitations (MVP)" section, briefly mentioning key aspects not yet implemented or potential issues (e.g., performance on very low-end hardware, specific scenarios where recognition might be less accurate, session-only chat history).
7.  The language used in the README is clear, concise, easy to understand for users who are tech enthusiasts or early adopters, and free of excessive technical jargon.
8.  The README file is formatted with proper Markdown for readability (headings, lists, code blocks for commands if any).

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [ ] **Task 1: Structure the `README.md` File (AC: 1, 8)**
    -   [ ] Create or take the existing `README.md` (potentially the developer-focused one from Story 1.0 recommendation).
    -   [ ] Define the main sections: Introduction, Features (MVP), Installation, Launching Sourcer, Basic Usage, Expected Recognizable Objects, Known Limitations (MVP), (Optional: Troubleshooting, Contact/Feedback).
-   [ ] **Task 2: Write Installation Instructions (AC: 2)**
    -   [ ] Detail where users can download the installer (e.g., "From the latest GitHub Release page for Sourcer MVP").
    -   [ ] Provide simple steps to run the `.exe` installer and complete the setup wizard on Windows.
-   [ ] **Task 3: Write Launching Instructions (AC: 3)**
    -   [ ] Explain how to find and run Sourcer after installation (e.g., "Look for 'Sourcer MVP' in your Start Menu or on your Desktop if you selected that option during installation.").
-   [ ] **Task 4: Write Basic Usage Instructions (AC: 4)**
    -   [ ] Briefly describe the main UI areas (Webcam, Chat/Log, Input Controls). A screenshot or simple ASCII diagram could be considered if helpful and easy to maintain.
    -   [ ] Explain how to use the `MicrophoneActivationControl` for voice queries (e.g., "Click the microphone button to start speaking your query. Click again to stop.").
    -   [ ] Explain how to use the `TextInputField` and "Send" button for text queries.
    -   [ ] Give an example query (e.g., "What do you see?" or "Describe this scene.").
-   [ ] **Task 5: List Recognizable Objects (AC: 5)**
    -   [ ] Create a list of the 10-15 common objects the MVP's vision pipeline is focused on recognizing, as per the PRD. (e.g., cup, book, keyboard, phone, plant, chair, table, monitor, mouse, person, laptop, bottle, scissors, pen, notebook).
-   [ ] **Task 6: Document Known Limitations (AC: 6)**
    -   [ ] Briefly list key limitations for the MVP. Examples:
        -   "Accuracy may vary depending on lighting, object clarity, and background."
        -   "Only a core set of common objects are reliably recognized (see list above)."
        -   "Complex scenes or multiple overlapping objects might result in general descriptions."
        -   "Voice and Text query history is for the current session only and is not saved."
        -   "Currently supports Windows 10/11 only."
        -   "Performance may vary based on your computer's hardware."
-   [ ] **Task 7: Review for Clarity and Readability (AC: 7, 8)**
    -   [ ] Read through the entire `README.md` to ensure the language is user-friendly and instructions are easy to follow.
    -   [ ] Check Markdown formatting for correctness and good presentation.

## Dev Technical Guidance

-   **Target Audience:** AI early adopters and tech enthusiasts. The tone can be slightly technical but should avoid deep jargon where possible.
-   **Content Source:**
    -   Installation details will come from the output of Story 6.1 (the installer process).
    -   UI interaction details come from the UI/UX Specification and how Stories 5.1 and 5.2 are implemented.
    -   Recognizable objects list is from the PRD Functional Requirements.
    -   Limitations should be realistic based on MVP scope and local model capabilities.
-   **Formatting:** Use standard Markdown. Headings, bullet points, lists, and bold text should be used effectively to structure the information. If commands are given (e.g., for a scripted setup, though installer is primary), use code blocks.
-   **Location:** This `README.md` should be the primary one in the root of the repository. If a developer-specific README was created earlier (per my recommendation for Story 1.0), its essential setup information might be merged or linked if it remains relevant for users attempting to build from source. For most users, the installer guide will be key.
