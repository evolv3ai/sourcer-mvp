# Sourcer Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goal, Objective and Context

Sourcer aims to make advanced AI vision capabilities both accessible and private by providing an intuitive, locally-running AI webcam application that users can interact with through natural voice commands. Many current AI vision tools are cloud-reliant, raising privacy concerns, or lack seamless real-time interaction. Sourcer addresses these challenges by offering a solution that processes visual information entirely on the user's device.

The primary objective of the MVP is to deliver a functional application that allows users to:
1.  Understand their immediate visual environment via their webcam using voice queries.
2.  Receive spoken and textual descriptions of common household/office objects and simple scenes.
3.  Ensure all AI processing (visual understanding, speech-to-text, text-to-speech) occurs locally on the user's machine.

This MVP targets AI early adopters, tech enthusiasts, privacy-conscious individuals, and developers interested in local multimodal AI. It serves as a foundation for the vision of Sourcer becoming the go-to application for effortless, private, and conversational visual understanding.

## Functional Requirements (MVP)

1.  **Real-time Webcam Video Feed Display:** The application must display a live video feed from the user's default webcam.
2.  **Voice-Activated Query Input:** Users must be able to initiate visual queries (e.g., "What do you see?") using their voice through a connected microphone.
3.  **Local Visual Scene Analysis:**
    * The application must use local AI models (Ultralytics YOLO, MobileSAM, LLaVA) to analyze the webcam feed.
    * It must identify and provide basic textual descriptions for at least 10-15 common household/office objects (e.g., cup, book, keyboard, phone, plant).
    * It should capture simple scene context (e.g., "A person is holding a red cup.").
4.  **Spoken Response Output:** The application must provide coherent, spoken responses to user queries, verbalizing the textual description generated by the visual analysis.
5.  **Textual Response Output:** The textual description generated from the visual analysis must also be displayed in the UI.
6.  **Basic Chat-like UI:**
    * The UI must display the webcam feed.
    * It must include a designated area to display the conversation history (user queries and system responses).
    * It must provide a text input field as a fallback mechanism for users to type queries if voice input is not working or preferred.
7.  **Local Processing Core:** All core AI components (vision models, speech-to-text, text-to-speech) and data processing must run entirely on the user's local machine. No image, audio, or derived data should be transmitted to external servers for processing.

## Non Functional Requirements (MVP)

1.  **Performance:**
    * **Voice Interaction Latency:** The round-trip time for a voice query to spoken response should ideally be less than 3 seconds to maintain a conversational feel.
    * **Resource Consumption:** The application should aim for reasonable CPU and RAM usage on typical user hardware (specific targets to be defined by the Architect based on model capabilities and optimization). The user experience should remain responsive.
2.  **Accuracy:**
    * **Visual Understanding:** Aim for >80% correct identification for a predefined set of 10-15 common objects. Descriptions should be rated as clear and relevant by testers.
    * **Speech-to-Text (STT) / Text-to-Speech (TTS):** While local models may have limitations, the STT/TTS should be accurate enough for users to complete tasks effectively (e.g., >90% task completion rate for visual queries via voice).
3.  **Privacy:** All user data (webcam feed, audio input, generated descriptions) must remain on the local device and not be transmitted externally. This needs to be verifiable.
4.  **Usability:**
    * The application should be relatively easy to install (considering the complexity of local AI dependencies). PostHog will be used for initial user feedback mechanisms.
    * The basic UI should be intuitive for the target audience.
5.  **Compatibility:**
    * **Operating System (MVP Focus):** Windows 10/11 (Initial decision for MVP scope management, further OS support can be post-MVP). Architect to confirm feasibility.
    * **Webcam:** Must work with the system's default webcam.
6.  **Installation:** A user-friendly installation package or clear setup instructions must be provided, considering the potential complexity of AI model dependencies.
7.  **Extensibility (Architectural consideration):** While not a direct MVP feature, the architecture should ideally allow for future enhancements like adding new models or capabilities with reasonable effort.

## User Interaction and Design Goals

* **Overall Vision & Experience:** The MVP should feel innovative yet straightforward. The experience should be centered around effortless voice interaction with the visual world. The design should be clean, functional, and modern minimalist, prioritizing clarity of information (video feed, text responses).
* **Key Interaction Paradigms:**
    * Primarily voice-driven queries ("Push-to-talk" or "Wake word" to be determined by Design Architect and technical feasibility for local STT).
    * Visual feedback via webcam display.
    * Auditory feedback via spoken responses.
    * Textual feedback and history in a chat-like interface.
* **Core Screens/Views (Conceptual):**
    * **Main Application Window:**
        * Prominent webcam video feed display.
        * Chat/Log area: Displays user queries (voice transcribed or typed) and system's textual responses.
        * Text input field for fallback queries.
        * Clear indicator of microphone status (e.g., listening, idle).
        * Basic settings access (if any for MVP, e.g., selecting microphone if multiple are present, though default is fine for MVP).
* **Accessibility Aspirations:** For MVP, focus on clear visual presentation of text and resizable text if feasible within the UI framework chosen. Keyboard navigation for the text input field is essential. Full accessibility compliance is a post-MVP goal.
* **Branding Considerations (High-Level):** No specific branding guidelines yet. Focus on a clean, tech-oriented aesthetic. A simple logo/icon for "Sourcer" would be beneficial.
* **Target Devices/Platforms:** Desktop application (Windows 10/11 for MVP).

## Technical Assumptions

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Core AI Models/Libraries:**
    * Vision: Ultralytics YOLO (for object detection), MobileSAM (for segmentation if needed for description context), LLaVA (for visual language modeling/description).
    * Orchestration & Voice: Pipecat (for managing voice pipeline, STT, TTS).
* **Local Processing Mandate:** All AI models and data processing pipelines must run locally.
* **Repository & Service Architecture:**
    * **Monorepo:** For the MVP, a monorepo structure is recommended. This simplifies dependency management, build processes, and initial development for a small, focused team working on a tightly integrated local application. All components (UI, core logic, AI model integrations) will reside within this single repository.
    * **Service Architecture:** The application will be a monolith from a deployment perspective (a single installable desktop application). Internally, it will consist of modular Python components orchestrated by Pipecat for the voice and AI pipeline, and a UI component (e.g., using a Python GUI framework like PyQt, Kivy, or a web-based UI packaged with Electron/Tauri if Python interop is smooth). The Architect will propose the most suitable UI framework.
    * **Rationale:** A monorepo and monolithic application structure reduce complexity for the MVP, focusing efforts on core functionality and local AI integration. This is suitable given the local-first nature and the need to manage complex local dependencies effectively.

### Testing requirements

* **Unit Testing:** Individual Python modules and functions (especially for AI model wrappers, data transformation, UI logic) should have unit tests.
* **Integration Testing:** Test the integration points between major components:
    * Webcam input to visual analysis pipeline.
    * Visual analysis output to text generation.
    * Text generation to TTS.
    * STT to query processing.
    * Core logic to UI updates.
* **End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Manual for MVP):** Define manual test scripts that cover the primary user flows:
    * User asks a voice query about a common object.
    * System correctly captures voice, analyzes the object, and provides an accurate spoken and textual response within performance targets.
    * Test with a predefined set of 10-15 objects and simple scenes.
    * Test fallback text input.
* **Local Testability (CLI for components):** Where feasible, core processing elements (e.g., running a visual analysis on a saved image file) should be testable via CLI commands for easier debugging by developers. This is a "Note for Architect."

            - Notes for Architect/Scrum Master: Consider graceful handling if no webcam is found or access is denied.

- **Epic 2: Local Speech-to-Text (STT) Integration**
    - Goal: Enable users to input queries using their voice, with the spoken words transcribed locally into text.
    - Story 3: As an AI Enthusiast, I want to use my voice to ask a question so that I can interact with Sourcer hands-free.
        - Acceptance Criteria:
            - Application can capture audio from the default system microphone.
            - User-initiated voice input (e.g., via a "start listening" button or a defined activation phrase if feasible with Pipecat locally) is processed.
            - The spoken words are transcribed into text by a local STT engine integrated via Pipecat.
            - The transcribed text is displayed in the chat/log area.
            - STT processing latency is minimized.
            - Notes for Architect/Scrum Master: Research and select a suitable local STT model for Pipecat. UI needs clear indication of listening state.

    - Goal: Integrate local AI models to analyze the webcam feed upon request and generate a textual description of the scene/objects.
    - Story 4: As an AI Enthusiast, when I initiate a query (via voice or text), I want Sourcer to locally analyze the current webcam image so that it can understand what it's looking at.
        - Acceptance Criteria:
            - When a query is received, the application captures a frame from the webcam feed.
            - The captured frame is processed by the local vision pipeline (YOLO, MobileSAM, LLaVA as orchestrated).
            - The vision pipeline generates a textual description of the primary objects (from the list of 10-15 target objects) and simple scene context.
            - The generated textual description is available for further processing (e.g., display and TTS).
            - The visual analysis process runs entirely locally.
            - Notes for Architect/Scrum Master: Focus on the 10-15 common objects for MVP. Architect to detail model chaining and optimization for local performance.
    - Story 5: As a Privacy-Conscious User, I want to be assured that the visual analysis occurs entirely on my device so that my visual data remains private.
        - Acceptance Criteria:
            - Network monitoring during visual analysis shows no transmission of image data to external servers.
            - All AI models (YOLO, MobileSAM, LLaVA) are confirmed to be running from local files/resources.

- **Epic 4: Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Conversational Output**
    - Goal: Enable Sourcer to respond to the user with spoken voice and display the textual response, completing the conversational loop.
    - Story 6: As an AI Enthusiast, after Sourcer analyzes the scene, I want to hear a spoken description of what it sees so that I can receive information hands-free.
        - Acceptance Criteria:
            - The textual description generated by the visual analysis is fed into a local TTS engine integrated via Pipecat.
            - The TTS engine generates audible speech corresponding to the text.
            - The spoken response is played back to the user through their default audio output.
            - TTS processing latency is minimized.
            - Notes for Architect/Scrum Master: Research and select a suitable local TTS model for Pipecat.
    - Story 7: As an AI Enthusiast, I want to see the textual description in the chat/log area along with my query so that I have a record of the interaction.
        - Acceptance Criteria:
            - The textual description generated by visual analysis is displayed in the chat/log area.
            - The user's transcribed query is also displayed, showing a conversational history.
            - Chat history persists for the current session.

- **Epic 5: Basic UI Controls and Fallback Input**
    - Goal: Provide essential UI controls for basic interaction and a fallback text input method.
    - Story 8: As an AI Enthusiast, I want a button or mechanism to explicitly trigger voice input listening so that I have control over when the microphone is active.
        - Acceptance Criteria:
            - A clear UI element (e.g., "Hold to Talk" button, "Click to Ask" button) exists to initiate voice input.
            - The microphone is only active for STT when explicitly engaged by the user via this control.
            - Visual feedback indicates when the application is listening.
    - Story 9: As an AI Enthusiast, I want to be able to type my query into a text field as an alternative to voice so that I can use the application if voice input is problematic or not preferred.
        - Acceptance Criteria:
            - A text input field is available in the UI.
            - Users can type a query and submit it (e.g., by pressing Enter or clicking a 'Send' button).
            - Typed queries trigger the same local visual analysis and response flow as voice queries.
            - The typed query and subsequent response appear in the chat/log history.

- **Epic 6: MVP Packaging and Documentation**
    - Goal: Package the application for user installation and provide basic usage documentation.
    - Story 10: As an AI Early Adopter, I want a simple way to install Sourcer on my Windows machine so that I can start using it quickly.
        - Acceptance Criteria:
            - An installer package (e.g., MSI, EXE) or a well-documented manual setup process (e.g., using pip with a requirements file within a Python environment) is provided for Windows.
            - The installation process includes all necessary local AI model dependencies.
            - Post-installation, the application is launchable via a shortcut or command.
            - Notes for Architect/Scrum Master: This is a significant risk area. Simplicity is key for MVP. Investigate tools like PyInstaller or similar, or a very clear script-based setup.
    - Story 11: As an AI Early Adopter, I want basic instructions on how to use Sourcer's MVP features so that I can understand its capabilities.
        - Acceptance Criteria:
            - A README file or simple help guide is included.
            - Instructions cover installation, launching, initiating voice/text queries, and understanding the output.
            - Lists the 10-15 common objects the MVP is trained to recognize.

### Critical Deficiencies
- None identified that would prevent proceeding to the Design Architect or Architect. The PRD is comprehensive for an MVP.

### Recommendations
1.  **Design Architect Engagement:** Proceed with engaging the Design Architect using the prompt in the PRD to detail UI/UX flows, wireframes, and specific error handling/edge case UIs.
2.  **Architect Engagement:** Following Design Architect input (or in parallel for non-UI aspects), engage the Architect using the prompt in the PRD. Key areas for Architect focus include:
    * Selection and integration strategy for local STT/TTS models within Pipecat, balancing performance and accuracy.
    * Optimizing the local visual analysis pipeline (YOLO, MobileSAM, LLaVA) for performance and resource consumption.
    * Designing a robust and user-friendly installation/packaging solution for Windows, addressing the dependency complexities of local AI models.
    * Detailing internal error handling and fault tolerance within the AI pipeline.
    * Defining clear development environment setup instructions.
3.  **User Feedback Loop:** Implement PostHog as planned for capturing user feedback and analytics during testing and initial rollout to validate usability and feature reception.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** While this PRD is for the MVP, acknowledge that NFRs (especially performance and resource use) may need iterative tuning based on early development and testing results with the chosen local models.

### Final Decision
-   **READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for detailed architectural design and subsequent UI/UX specification.
