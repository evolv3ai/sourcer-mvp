# Epic 4: Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Conversational Output

> This document is a granulated shard from the main "Sourcer Product Requirements Document (PRD)" focusing on "Epic 4: Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Conversational Output".

- **Goal:** Enable Sourcer to respond to the user with spoken voice and display the textual response, completing the conversational loop.
- **Story 6: As an AI Enthusiast, after Sourcer analyzes the scene, I want to hear a spoken description of what it sees so that I can receive information hands-free.**
    - Acceptance Criteria:
        - The textual description generated by the visual analysis is fed into a local TTS engine integrated via Pipecat.
        - The TTS engine generates audible speech corresponding to the text.
        - The spoken response is played back to the user through their default audio output.
        - TTS processing latency is minimized. [cite: 530]
        - Notes for Architect/Scrum Master: Research and select a suitable local TTS model for Pipecat.
- **Story 7: As an AI Enthusiast, I want to see the textual description in the chat/log area along with my query so that I have a record of the interaction.**
    - Acceptance Criteria:
        - The textual description generated by visual analysis is displayed in the chat/log area.
        - The user's transcribed query is also displayed, showing a conversational history. [cite: 533]
        - Chat history persists for the current session.
