# Epic 3: Core Local Visual Analysis and Description

> This document is a granulated shard from the main "Sourcer Product Requirements Document (PRD)" focusing on "Epic 3: Core Local Visual Analysis and Description".

- **Goal:** Integrate local AI models to analyze the webcam feed upon request and generate a textual description of the scene/objects.
- **Story 4: As an AI Enthusiast, when I initiate a query (via voice or text), I want Sourcer to locally analyze the current webcam image so that it can understand what it's looking at.**
    - Acceptance Criteria:
        - When a query is received, the application captures a frame from the webcam feed.
        - The captured frame is processed by the local vision pipeline (YOLO, MobileSAM, LLaVA as orchestrated).
        - The vision pipeline generates a textual description of the primary objects (from the list of 10-15 target objects) and simple scene context.
        - The generated textual description is available for further processing (e.g., display and TTS).
        - The visual analysis process runs entirely locally. [cite: 520]
        - Notes for Architect/Scrum Master: Focus on the 10-15 common objects for MVP. Architect to detail model chaining and optimization for local performance.
- **Story 5: As a Privacy-Conscious User, I want to be assured that the visual analysis occurs entirely on my device so that my visual data remains private.**
    - Acceptance Criteria:
        - Network monitoring during visual analysis shows no transmission of image data to external servers.
        - All AI models (YOLO, MobileSAM, LLaVA) are confirmed to be running from local files/resources.
