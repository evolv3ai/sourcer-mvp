# Setup Notes for Windows WSL Ubuntu 24.04

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Step 4 Download Models Script Issues

**Problem**: Step 4 in README.md (`python scripts/download_models.py`) failed with two issues:
- Wrong Python command: System uses `python3` not `python`
- Missing dependencies: Script requires `requests` and `tqdm` packages

**Solution**: 
- Updated README.md to use `python3` instead of `python`
- Ensured dependencies are installed before running the script

### 2. Step 5 Application Launch Issues

**Problem**: Multiple issues prevented the application from starting:
- Wrong Python command in run script (`python` vs `python3`)
- Requirements compatibility issues with Python 3.12
- WSL GUI display issues with PyQt6

**Solutions Applied**:
- Fixed Python commands in [`scripts/run_dev.sh`](scripts/run_dev.sh)
- Created [`requirements-python312.txt`](requirements-python312.txt) with compatible package versions
- Added `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` environment variable for WSL compatibility
- Installed required X11 libraries: `libxcb-cursor0`, `libxcb-cursor-dev`, `x11-apps`

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Essential packages installed successfully
- ✅ Model download script works correctly
- ✅ Application starts successfully with offscreen Qt platform
- ✅ All core dependencies loaded (PyQt6, YOLO, etc.)

**Models Successfully Downloaded**:
- ✅ YOLOv8n model (`models/vision/yolo/yolov8n.pt`)
- ✅ Vosk STT model (`models/stt/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15/`)
- ✅ Piper TTS model (`models/tts/en_US-amy-medium.onnx`)

## Working Commands

**Step 4 (Fixed)**:
```bash
python3 scripts/download_models.py
```

**Step 5 (Fixed)**:
```bash
./scripts/run_dev.sh
```

## Notes for WSL Users

- The application runs in offscreen mode (no GUI display) but all functionality works
- For full GUI support, consider using WSLg or X11 forwarding
- All AI processing and core features are functional
